            <h2>M-extension support for SERV</h2>
            <p>This project aims to design and integrate the integer “Multiplication and Division Unit (MDU)” with SERV core as a co-processor. 
               The MDU will support all the instructions that are provided in “‘The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual. Volume I: Unprivileged ISA’ chapter 7, M-Standard Extension for Integer Multiplication and Division, Version 2.0”. This MDU is to be designed in a way that it would use most of the DSP resources on the targeted FPGA board.              
               It would be generic and parameterized so that it can easily be integrated with any of the RISC-V cores.
